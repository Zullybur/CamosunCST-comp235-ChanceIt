Chance-It Game Rules
------------------------------------
1.  A game of Chance-It involves two players.
    The object of the game is to be the player
    with the highest score after completing 20
    rounds of play.

2.  During a round, each player takes a turn.
    A playerâ€™s total score is the sum of their
    turn scores. At the beginning of the game,
    each player rolls a die: high goes first.

3.  At the beginning of their turn, a player
    rolls two six-sided dice and records the sum,
    called their first roll.

4.  After their first roll, a player must decide
    whether to stop or continue (i.e., chance-it).

5.  If a player decides to stop, then their turn
    ends and their score for that turn is the sum
    of all rolls during that turn; if the player
    decides to continue, they roll the dice again.

6.  If in re-rolling the dice, a player re-rolls
    their first roll (any combination of dice that
    results in the same sum), then their turn ends
    and their score for that turn is zero;
    otherwise, go to step 5.
